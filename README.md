# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis 
## Project Summary
This repository offers an in-depth SQL analysis of Rockbuster Stealth’s business data to address strategic questions from the management board for their 2020 strategy. It identifies top and bottom revenue-generating movies, average rental durations, customer locations, high-value customer hotspots, and regional sales variations. SQL queries and analysis provide data-driven insights, which are visualized for clear, actionable information.

## Key Questions & Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
  1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data & Tools
For the analysis, Rockbuster’s relational database management system and PostgreSQL were utilized. 
Data handling was performed using pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL, while visualizations were created with Tableau Public.

### Key data points
- Film Inventory: Details about available movies, genres, and rental durations.
